# Palindrome Verifier

Input a potential palindrome and this tool will check to see if it's indeed a palindrome!

It has a real time visualization. As you type, it will append a "ghost" of the reversed string at the end of what you're typing. Of course, it'll eliminate overlapping letters. For example, if you type:

UFO

It will only show UFOFU.

Once you add the letter T, it will show UFOTOFU. It supports spaces, and will remove spaces from the mirrored letters.
